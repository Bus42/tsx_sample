# CRA/TS Drag and Drop

This project is a simple demonstration of the drag and drop functionality in React using TypeScript with the help of the 'react-movable' library. This uses a fairly standard typography layout with two placeholders to represent data spaces and a list of items that can be dragged and dropped to reorder them.
